VOLUME (VOL) : L=volume up. Shift+l=volume down.
	Volume sets the peek gain of the envelope. 15 is 	max. 0 is off.

WAVE FORM (WAV) : :=wave up. Shift+:=wave down.
	0=the Vics normal square wave. 1-15=pusle waves 	provided by Viznuts pwp pulse wave technique.			
	The selected wave form is applied across all active 	voices except for the noise channel.

VOICE (VOC) : ;=voice up. Shift+;=voice down
	VOC selects between different combonations of the 	Vics 4 voice channels
		0=all voices off

A/R ENVELOPE

ATTACK (ATT) : ,=attack up. Shift+,=attack down (0-99)
	Attack determines the amount of time it takes for 	the volume to reach the peak gain (VOL) when a 	key is pressed.

RELEASE (REL) : .=release up. Shift+.=release down (0-99)
  	Release determines the amount of time it takes for 	the volume to reach 0 after a key is released.

The envelope does not re-trigger when a new key is pressed. If a new key is pressed the new note triggers but the envelope continues

When volume=0 and a key is pressed the attack slope is triggered. Volume increases by 1 every int(att/vol) ticks of the jiffy clock until volume=vol.  

If a key is still held down after the attack slope has ended then the note will hold at peak gain until released.

When a key is released the release slope is triggered. Volume decreases by 1 every int(rel/vol) ticks of the jiffy clock until volume=0. If a new key is pressed befor volume=0 then the attack slope will be triggered from the current volume level.
